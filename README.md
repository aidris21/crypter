<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> End-to-end encryption has become a staple on communications online, and it has become a hot-button political issue in several nations, a battle between governments fighting for law enforcement and tech companies fighting for cybersecurity. Given that this political issue requires familiarity with cyber-encryption schemes, and therefore requires familiarity with algorithms and number theory, it can feel daunting to the average, non-technical person.</p> 
<p> So, we've decided to develop a hands-on way of learning about how modern encryption works. We've created a basic messaging app that most people might use, but we've stripped back the curtain and visualized the components of how a message is encrypted and decrypted. In this way, any user can get an idea of what happens to their message when using end-to-end encryption, why it can be complicated, how it's designed to be hard to break, and therefore better understand the discussion surrounding the issue.</p>
